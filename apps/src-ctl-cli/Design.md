# Requirements

- Unified code & data solution
- Large binary files: Central database
- Support for live workflows: Branches
- Predictable merges: Central locking across branches
- Support for distributed build tools: Shared virtual workspaces

---

# Requirement: Unified code & data solution

- Code and data have interdependencies
- Atomic changes across code & data in a single commit
- Unified tools and processes for all crafts

---

# Requirement: Large binary files

- Fully distributed history is impractical when dealing with large binary files
- Central database and shallow (or even virtual) workspaces are the way to go here

---

# Requirement: Support for live workflows

- Branches!
- Git branches are very efficient in size and speed

---

# Requirement: Predictable merges

- Conflicts are the dark side of branches
- Central locking Ã  la perforce is not good enough with binary files
  * Only pushes back the conflict to the branch merge
- Solution: locking across branch families
  * Implicit lock domains based on explicit branch parenting
  * Attached branches share a lock domain
  * Detaching a branch creates a new lock domain
- Even better: app metadata `inside` the lock
  * Allows to override/augment lock when conflict-free merge is guaranteed

# Requirement: Support for distributed build tools
## Problem statement
> Hundreds of instances of a microservice are spawned to work on a small part of the data kept under source control. How can we give them efficient access in read and write?

Shared, virtual workspaces.

Like a local workspace, it's a set of modifications based on a branch at a specific revision (commit).

 * Unmodified files are fetched on demand.
 * No concurrency guarantees.
