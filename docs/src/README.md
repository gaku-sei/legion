# Legion Engine, Tools and Pipelines

If you ask Legion Labs what makes a good engine, the spot light is going to be put on these 3 elements:
 * Iteration time (programmers, artists, content creator to QC loop)
 * Ability to take fully advantage of the end user hardware
 * Ability to evolve and adapt to the use cases

As such Legion is just not an engine, it's a collection of tools and pipelines that try to push the boundaries on these aspects.

## A focus on iteration time at any scale

It is no secret that the ability to iterate fast is what makes a difference once you have a good idea to bring it to the level of quality you want. 

### Good tools

### Fast builds

### Collaboration at scale

## Harnessing the power of the execution environment

Engines are some of the most performance intensive programs, moving 8 Millions pixels, backed by thousands of objects that have complex physics attached to them and more or less complex behavior is not an easy feat and is not something that is achieved by acts of random programming.

### The cloud is our editor's target

### Taking advantage of proven performance paradigms

### GPU based rendering

## Ability to evolve and change

The gaming industry being product oriented by design, took more time to adopt better sofware engineering practices, like automated testing. And the complexity of the games have makes the problem a lot harder than in other industries. Games try more and more to be closer to the rules of reality, and the reality is made of hundred of tightly coupled systems that interact with each other in real time.
