# Structured Data Model

The primary role of the `structured data model` is to provide a formal description of the data structures. It also defines properties of the data used in different contexts.

We differentiate 2 `data model`s that define two different kinds of data representation (see [Design Overview](design-overview.md) for more context):
- *offline data model* - optimized for writing and multi-user editing
- *runtime data model* - optimized for reading 

> `TODO`: More design coming soon:
> - Data parenting / overriding
> - Build time transformations between (*offline* -> *runtime*)
> - Offline data format versioning & conversion
> - Common UI support for offline data format
> - More...
